Some notes and suggestions to improve the documentation:

Use either SB and UJ or B and J for instruction types, don't mix it.

Assembler listing of instruction is confusing. Instruction 0x12345678
is listed as 0x78563412. Don't write out a word in byte oder.

Branch explanation: is it PC or next PC?

Question to me:

Don't understand why a shift by 2 (instead of 1) is needed when the
immediate for the branch is already in multiples of 2 bytes?
